MPRISv2 plugin for the DeaDBeeF music player
============================================

===== About ======
This plugin aims to implement the MPRISv2[1] for DeaDBeeF.

The original[2] MPRIS plugin for DeaDBeef does not work anymore and seems
to be orphaned. The original plugin supported MPRISv1 AND MPRISv2. This plugin
will only support version two.

This plugin should be a complete rewrite, but i ended up copying most of
the Code from the original plugin.

- The whole optional "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Playlists" interface.
